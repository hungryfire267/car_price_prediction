# Car Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various vehicle features. The goal is to analyse historical car data and generate accurate price predictions using regression techniques.

## Overview
Accurate car price estimation helps buyers, sellers, and dealerships make informed decisions.

This notebook walks through:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Price prediction

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
## Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (mean and mode)
- Encode categorical variables
- Feature scaling (min-max, z scaling)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Feature distribution visualisation
- Outlier detection

3. Model Training
- Train-test split
- Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning
4. Model Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
